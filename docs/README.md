Original version for arch is in the here **[yayfzf][yayfzf-url]**

Gentoo package finder to search, install, remove, and manage packages using emerge.

This is a modified version of yayfzf to work with emerge.
There´re some problems that need to be resolved.

Problems are:
- ~~Selected multiple pkgs, ctrl+x only want to install one pkg~~
- ~~Used sudo (Later will change to doas, or do a root check, I don´t know)~~

Feel free to help.
